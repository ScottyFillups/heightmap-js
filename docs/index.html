    <h1>Terrapaint</h1>
    <h2>A simple wrapper that lets you draw heightmaps easily.</h2>
    <h3>
      The Terrapaint module (found on NPM) exports a wrapper
      that takes a noise function, along with the height
      and width of your canvas, and paints a heightmap!
    </h3>
    <p>
      Terrapaint comes with many options that gives you control of
      your heightmap, such as specifying octaves and frequencies, and 
      setting your own custom color map.
    </p>
    <p>Try manipulating some of the heightmaps below!</p>
